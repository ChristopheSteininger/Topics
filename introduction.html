                <h1>What are neural networks?</h1>
                
                <p>
                    Neural Networks are logical (or physical) structures in which multiple nodes communicate with each other through synapses that interconnect them.
                    They respond to input by modifying their behaviour, self-adjusting to create consistent responses.

                <h2>ANN - Artificial Neural Networks</h2>
                               
                <p>
                     ANNs help to address problems whose solutions are complex and impractical to formulate explicitly. Their idea is analogous to the structure and behaviour of the biological nervous system. How the human brain actually works is an elaborate and complex mystery so the actual models rely more on the observed brain performance characteristic. This includes exhibiting particular characteristics like learning
 from experience, deriving from previous data to the new one and extracting abstract but valuable data from input containing irrelevant data.</p>
 
<p>An important fact to note is that ANN generalises automatically as a result of its structure, not by implementing human reasoning in the form of logically designed programs. This is why, once trained, they have the ability to see through minor noise and distortion comparably to the human brain dealing with the "imperfections" of the world.
                </p>
			    
			    <h2>How do ANNs work</h2>
			       
			    <p>
			        There exist many paradigms for artificial neural networks, however most of them are based on a set of a large number of interconnected nodes that work together to compute output nodes, using the input and weights (synapses).

Such a network will need to be trained so that application of a set of inputs produces the desired (or at least consistent) set of outputs. This process is analogous to
 human brain learning patterns and remembering relevant information. To achieve this, various training algorithms have been developed, mostly of two types; supervised and
 unsupervised learning. </p>
<h3>Supervised learning</h3>
<p>
Supervised learning requires the pairing of each input with the corresponding target output. Together these are called a training pair. Usually a network is trained over a plentiful of such training pairs. An input is applied, the output of the network is calculated using its current settings (i.e. the weights) and the difference (error) between the target output and the calculated result is computed. The error is then fed back to the network and used to adjust the network such that the error is minimised. The algorithm is applied consecutively to each training pair so that at the end of training the error for the entire training set is at an acceptably low level.</p>
<h3>Unsupervised learning</h3>
<p>
Unsupervised learning is a more complex model of learning when compared to the supervised learning, although it is essentially the corresponding model of learning in biological systems. It is the answer to criticism of  supervised learning as a biologically irrational model. It is difficult and presumably incorrect to reason of the brain as a mechanism that learns everything through comparing desired and actual outputs, trying to minimise the error between the two. If this were to happen in real life, where would the desired outputs come from? Unsupervised learning requires no target output, and hence, no comparisons are carried out to adjust the network. The training set consists solely of inputs. The algorithm modifies network weights to produce outputs that are consistent with each other. This mean that a two sufficiently similar inputs will result in the same pattern of outputs. The training process, therefore, relies mostly on extracting statistical properties of the training set, grouping similar inputs together. The difficulty for an unsupervised algorithm is, of course, to identify reasonably the number of such groups that can be created from the inputs and the choice of non-biased boundaries between them. The task of making universally accepted classification of data can be often difficult even for people.

                <h2>Possible Drawbacks</h2>
                <p>
                    Despite all those years of effort on trying to make artificial neural networks resemble the biological model as closely as possible, awareness of their limitations has always been a
                    concern and a topic of lively discussions. Not even the most optimistic scientist will suggest that ANNs will soon duplicate the actual functions of the human brain. Enthusiasm is
                    moderated when the studies show that the actual "intelligence" exhibited by the most sophisticated networks seems to be below the level of a tapeworm. </p>
                    
                    <p>It is, however, an incorrect
                    decision to underestimate the surprising brainlike performance of ANNs that can be achieved in certain cases - something that has happened to the ANN research field before, considerably
                    cooling down the interests and advancements in this field for a period of time. The abilities, even if limited to this day, give a hint that deep understanding of human intelligence may
                    lie close at hand, while the revolutionary applications of this progress are already arriving.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Applications</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Neural networks can have many different applications, in areas such as classification, clustering, pattern recognition, forecasting,
                    optimisation and searching. These can mostly be categorised into two classes, supervised and unsupervised learning.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Supervised learning</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Supervised learning, as implied by the name, has a so called teacher to guide it. For neural networks, this means
                    giving it data with an input and an expected output. Using this, the network can learn what inputs correspond to
                    what outputs, and eventually (with enough training data) it should be able to extrapolate what it has learnt onto
                    an input it hasn't seen before, and calculate the correct output. This is an example of classification - in a more
                    abstract way, the network assigns classes to each object.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    An example of this is recognising printed from handwritten characters, or determining signal sources, since these can be
                    done provided an accurate and plentiful data source is provided.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Unsupervised learning</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Unsupervised learning means there is no teaching/training, so the network has to heuristically work out a given problem
                    using its environment or a different kind of sample data. The main subset of this is clustering, where a network groups
                    together objects that are similar to each other. For example, a network could classify animals into their species by
                    clustering together similar types.
                </p.
