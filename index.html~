                <h1>What are neural networks?</h1>
                
                <p>
                    Neural Networks are logical (or physical) structures in which multiple nodes communicate with each other through synapses that interconnect them.
                    They respond to input by modifying their behaviour, self-adjusting to create consistent responses.

                <h2>ANN - Artificial Neural Networks</h2>
                               
                <p>
                    ANNs help to address problems whose solutions are complex and impractical to formulate explicitly. Their idea is analogous to
                    the structure and behaviour of the biological nervous system. How the human brain actually works is an elaborate and complex mystery
                    so the actual models rely more on the observed brain performance characteristic. This includes exhibiting particular characteristics like learning
                    from experience, deriving from previous data to the new one and extracting abstract but valuable data from input cointaining irrelevant data.
                </p>
			    
			    <h2>How do ANNs work</h2>
			       
			    <p>
			        The esssential function of ANNs is to compute output nodes using its inputs and weights (synapses). However, such a network will need to be trained, analogously to
			        human brain learning patterns and remembering relevant information. To achieve this, various training algorithms have been developed, mostly of two types; supervised and
			        unsupervised learning. 
			    </p>

                           <h2>Possible Drawbacks</h2>
<p>
Despite all those years of effort on trying to make artificial neural networks resemble the biological model as closely as possible, awareness of their limitations has always been a concern and a topic of lively discussions. Not even the most optimistic scientist will suggest that ANNs will soon duplicate the actual functions of the human brain. Enthusiasm is moderated when the studies show that the actual “intelligence” exhibited by the most sophisticated networks seems to be below the level of a tapeworm. It is, however, an incorrect decision to underestimate the surprising brainlike performance of ANNs that can be achieved in certain cases - something that has happened to the ANN research field before, considerably cooling down the interests and advancements in this field for a period of time. The abilities, even if limited to this day, give a hint that deep understanding of human intelligence may lie close at hand, while the revolutionary applications of this progress are already beginning to arrive.
