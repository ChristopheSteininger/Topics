                <p>
                    Neural Networks are logical (or physical) structures in which multiple nodes communicate with each other
                    through synapses that interconnect them. They respond to input by modifying their behaviour, self-adjusting to create
                    consistent responses.

                <h2>ANN - Artificial Neural Networks</h2>
                               
                <p>
                    ANNs help to address problems whose solutions are complex and impractical to formulate explicitly. Their idea is analogous to
                    the structure and behaviour of the biological nervous system. How the human brain actually works is an elaborate and complex mystery
                    so the actual models rely more on the observed brain performance characteristic. This includes exhibiting particular characteristics like learning
                    from experience, deriving from previous data to the new one and extracting abstract but valuable data from input cointaining irrelevant data.
                </p>
			    
			    <h2>How do ANNs work.</h2>
			       
			    <p>
			        The esssential function of ANNs is to compute output nodes using its inputs and weights (synapses). However, such a network will need to be trained, analogously to
			        human brain learning patterns and remembering relevant information. To achieve this, various training algorithms have been developed, mostly of two types; supervised and
			        unsupervised learning.
